# Instructor notes

 - See the notebook template in the info repository for how to format your notebook.
 - Notebook python cells do not need "#!/usr/bin/env python3"
 - Notebook python cells do not need your name in each. They should be concise and to the point.
 - You should not use globals implicitly in your modules. For your convergent sum, you left k and tol undefined in the function, relying on them being globals defined elsewhere. This makes code hard to understand for colleagues.
 - Check your results. Did your result for fibs look correct? Did the convergent sum converge to the correct value? How do you know?
